# Triple Ten Spots Project

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief from Figma layouts

## Project features/description

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid System
- Flat BEM file structure
- Responsive layout for Desktop and Mobile

## Figma

https://www.figma.com/design/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project%3A-Spots?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=IMIsA4Q4QpRgdIk8-0

## Images

Exported from Figma and optimized using TinyPNG. The size didnt change much when converted for optimization. 

## Plan on improving the project

- Make buttons clickable so actions like "Edit Profile" can work
- Maybe when images are hovered over, they can pop out.
